I'm just a girl finally programming my own website. It took me 3 years to start but look at me now 🧚🏻‍♀️<br />
Hope to actually, really release it soon ([monauppi.com](https://monauppi.com/)) and not just have a placholder website containing a never ending, hopelessly romantic, sad playlist and a cringe background that reminds me of websites from 15 years ago (I was literally 9 then) ✨

# Angular
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
